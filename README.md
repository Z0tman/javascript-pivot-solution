Here I build custom objects to make rotation from the canvas web object itself
Since the default javascript canvas doesn't allow me to make pivot control on several objects, I made the pivot myself, so I can control several object by rotation.

Should be run from brackets or VSCode from a new folder to run a web page from localhost.
